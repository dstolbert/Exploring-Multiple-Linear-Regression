    "Assuming that all the assumptions are met for this model, the additional statistics we would need to appropriately interpret these coefficients are their respective p-values. Assuming the coefficients are all statistically significant, the model states that all families spend a minimum of 873/yr on recreation. This value increases by .0012 for every increase in annual income plus a quadratic increase of .00002 * annual income. This value also decreases by 223.57/yr if the family has kids."

    "Nothing dramatically changed in the model from removing these features. Most features have a relatively small effect on housing price according to their coefficients. The feature with the greatest effect on housing price is the overalqual variable, which is a score between 0 and 10 ranking the quality of the house. Intuitively this makes sense as the overall quality of the house should have the greatest effect on housing prices. Additionally, the coefficients in this model are difficult to interpret as the scale of the target variable (sale price) has been changed through a Box-Cox tation. "
